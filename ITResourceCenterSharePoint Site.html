  <h3 class="section-title">IT Resource Center – SharePoint Site (Michels)</h3>

  <!-- Short description -->
  <p>
    I designed and built a modern SharePoint communication site that acts as a central
    <strong>IT Resource Center</strong> for Michels employees. The site brings together
    announcements, IT help, self-service tools, security training, and document governance
    in one easy-to-use place.

  <!-- Key features -->
  <h4>Key Features I Implemented</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Branded landing page</strong> using Michels colors (red / white / black) with
        a welcome banner and clear messaging: “Everything you need for work resources, files,
        and announcements – all right here.”</li>
    <li><strong>Announcements section</strong> so IT can quickly share news, outages, and
        updates with all employees.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick links &amp; navigation</strong> to:
      <ul>
        <li>IT help &amp; support</li>
        <li>Password reset and access requests</li>
        <li>Security policies and guidelines</li>
        <li>New hire / onboarding resources</li>
        <li>Training &amp; self-service how-to guides</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Document libraries</strong> organized by category (policies, procedures,
        guides, templates) with metadata and views to make content easy to find.</li>
    <li><strong>Document life-cycle automation</strong> using Power Automate:
      <ul>
        <li>When a document is updated, users get email + Teams notifications.</li>
        <li>Document owners receive alerts when others modify their content.</li>
        <li>Every 3 months, owners get an automatic reminder to review/retire documents.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Self-service forms</strong> (SharePoint/Microsoft Forms) for reporting IT
        issues, submitting suggestions, and requesting access – all feeding into SharePoint
        lists for tracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Security &amp; training area</strong> with links to security awareness training,
        phishing guidance, and best-practice checklists.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong> using SharePoint usage data and Power BI concepts to track
        which pages and documents are used most.</li>
  </ul>

      In this project I designed an IT Resource Center for Michels on SharePoint. The goal
      was to give employees one place for IT announcements, help, and documentation.
      I created a branded landing page with clear navigation, then built libraries for
      policies, procedures, and guides so content is organized and searchable.
      <br><br>
      I also automated the document life cycle using Power Automate: users are notified
      when content changes, and owners receive quarterly reminders to review their
      documents so information stays accurate. Finally, I added self-service forms and
      a security training area so employees can solve common IT problems on their own.
      This project shows my skills in SharePoint design, automation, and creating
      real business value with Microsoft 365.
